# Go

Go apps are supported on Drycc by the [Go
buildpack](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-go).

## Detection

The Go buildpack is used if the repository contains any filenames ending with
`.go`.

## Dependencies

The Go buildpack allows you to specify and install your dependencies using
`godep`, which saves application dependencies into the git repo so that the
application can be reproducibly deployed.

### godep

To save dependencies using [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep), run `godep
save` in your app directory and commit the `Godeps` and `vendor` directories.
When you deploy to Drycc, the packages in the `Godeps` directory will be used.

### Go Version

When you use `godep`, the `GoVersion` property in the `Godeps/Godeps.json` file
is used to specify the Go version.

If you do not use `godep`, the latest version of Go known by the buildpack will
be used.

## Binaries

All main packages in the repo are compiled and binaries placed in the `/app/bin`
directory, which is in the `PATH`. Binaries are named after the directory that
contains them.

If the root of the repo contains a main package, the binary name
is derived from the package path. The path is read from the `ImportPath` property
of `Godeps/Godeps.json` if you are using `godep`, or the `.godir` file if you
are not.

## Process Types

The process types your app supports are declared in a `Procfile` in the root
directory, which contains one line per type in the format `TYPE: COMMAND`.

For example: if you have a main package in the root of your repository, and the
package path is `github.com/drycc/myserver`, the binary will be named
`myserver`, and you should have something like this in your `Procfile`:

```text
web: myserver
```

The `web` process type has an HTTP route by default and a corresponding `PORT`
environment variable that the server should listen on.
