# Some useful aliases when working on the vagrant box.
#
# You can revert to using the built-in commands by escaping these aliases, e.g. to run
# /usr/bin/drycc-host, use "\drycc-host" which will not use the alias.
#
# You may find it useful to add "source /vagrant/script/development-aliases" to ~/.bashrc

alias drycc="/vagrant/cli/bin/drycc"
alias drycc-host="/vagrant/host/bin/drycc-host"
alias drycc-release="/vagrant/util/release/drycc-release"
