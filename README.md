Drycc is designed to run anything that can run on Linux, not just stateless web
apps. Drycc comes with highly available database appliances, including
PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.

Eventually we want Drycc to be the only tool developers and ops teams need to
develop, deploy, and manage running software.

You can learn more about Drycc at [our website](https://drycc.cc).

The Drycc website also has [documentation](https://drycc.cc/docs).

### Status
